# Learn Angular 4 in Baby Steps
We will learn Angular 4 by taking small incremental steps. But before we start with Angular 4 we will first have to learn TypeScript and Reactive Programming:

We will be using VSCode as our Editor, just open the project file in VSCode. Read the readme.md file in each project.

Install VS Code Editor: https://code.visualstudio.com/
